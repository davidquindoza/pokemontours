<br><h2 align = "center"> HAVE SOME FAQS ABOUT ALOLA REGION! </h2><br>

<br>
<p class = "faq" align = "justify"><q>The islands of Alola were given form when underground volcanoes erupted long, long ago.
Pokémon came to live in Alola when they flew, swam or were carried on the wind to the isles.</q>
Alola is a popular destination for tourists, attracting visitors from many different regions.
The name “Alola” is meant to incorporate a meaning of a land that overflows with life force and supports various forms of life. <br>
<br>The Region contains five islands: Melemele Island, Akala Island, Ulaùla Island, Poni Island and Aether Paradise.
Each Island caters to different homes of Pokémon, with some exlusive only in this certain island.
Trainers often come here due to Alolan Pokemon having different variants from their original counterparts in different regions. </p><br>
<br>
<h2 align = "center"> GYM BADGES ARE GONE! </h2>
<br>
<p class = "faq" align = "justify">
The quest to battle gym leaders and earn badges has been a series hallmark since the past franchises,
Pokemon Sun and Moon featuring Alola takes the bold step of ditching these elements altogether.
Instead, players are tasked with beating island trials and facing off against various captains on each of the Alola region’s four islands.
At the end of these challenges, you’ll still face off against a powerful foe, but the road to get there is much more varied than it’s been in the past.</p>

<h2 align = "center"> WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT IN THE WILD AREA? </h2>
<br>
<p class = "faq" align = "justify">In an effort to make players actually want to head into sections of tall grass,
  Sun and Moon have tweaked wild Pokémon encounters to make them less tedious and more dynamic.
  Now, wild Pokémon are able to use a “call for help” mechanic that allows them to cry out for
  help in the middle of an encounter and potentially gain an assist from another Pokémon.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h2 align = "center"> DITCH HM SLAVES! YOU CAN GET POKEMON RIDES! </h2>
<br>
<p class = "faq" align = "justify">One of the most oft-requested features for new Pokémon games is the ability to freely ride any Pokémon
  while exploring and Sun and Moon finally introduces this feature. Functioning similarly to HM moves of past games, Pokémon Rides
  let you summon a Pokémon to, well, ride, but the stipulation is that they cannot be used in battle. </p>

<br>
<br>
<h2 align = "center"> ALOLAN REGIONAL VARIANTS </h2>
<br>
<p class = "faq" align = "justify">Helping to tie Sun and Moon’s tropical theme into the Pokémon themselves is the introduction of Alola forms,
  which transform various first-generation Pokémon into bigger, stronger versions. For instance, there’s a super tall Exeggutor
  that has Dragon abilities and ice versions of Nintales and Sandslash.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h2 align = "center"> BATTLE ROYAL! </h2>
<br>
<p class = "faq" align = "justify">Sun and Moon franchises featuring Alola Regiona don’t add much in the way of new multiplayer features over the previous games,
  but they do add one new mode that is sure to lead to make waves among the player base: Battle Royal. Like the
  name implies, this mode is a free-for-all frenzy that pits four players against each other at once.</p>
<br>
<div class="img">

<br>
<br>
<h2 align = "center"> Z CRYSTALS! </h2>
<br>
<p class = "faq" align = "justify"> Across Alola Region, trainers are given a device called a Z-Ring that allows them to hold Z-Crystals,
  which can be found hidden throughout the Alola region. These crystals can be used in battle to unleash a
  devestating super move, but only if the Pokémon  being used has a move that corresponds to the crystal type.</p>

<br>
<h2 align = "center"> ROTOMDEX! </h2>
<br>
<p class = "faq" align = "justify"> An essential item in every trainer’s toolbox, the familiar Pokédex  has been given a substantial overhaul
  in \Alola Region  when you visit. A rare Pokémon called Rotom  (it can possess electronic devices) will act as a modern AI
  assistant to the dex. Additionally, the new Pokédex allows for new ways to discover Pokémon , including the ability to scan
  QR codes with the 3DS that provide additional information about specific Pokémon  and various secrets about the Alola region
  in which the game is set.</p>

<h2 align = "center"> OTHER FAQS! </h2>
<br>
<p class = "faq" align = "justify"> Just kidding man, the rest of Alola Region shouldn't be exposed just right away. Why? Because the rest of the other parts
of the Region are yours to explore on your own! So hop on your boats and prepare a load of money for a grand adventure! Don't know
where to start? No problem! Click the "Rates" link and see if you can fare with the prices : D </p>
